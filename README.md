# GymTracker

An app for me and to demo different technologies.
> It's worth emphasising that this app is designed for me, so the layout and UX is exactly what I want and doesn't take other peoples views into account.
> 
> The code however, is aimed at others. It's a demonstration of my learning journey and interest in different languages / frameworks & concepts.

## POCs

The goal of the POCs is to demonstrate similar concepts in different languages / technologies

### POC 1 Initial Ideas - Angular

This poc is mainly focused on layout and UX. Created in Angular because it's my most familiar front end skill. This is very much a throw away project. There are NO best practices here, just lots of quick hacks. Also I decided to move on to POC2 quite quickly when the POC technical debt was too large.

### POC 2 Idea Progression - React

I hadn't worked in React for 4 or 5 years, so I decided this was a good point to re-learn.  ``useState`` wasn't even a thing the last time I used it. After a bit of research I settled on [Joti](https://jotai.org/) for the state management. Where possible I have tried to follow best practice and to create a POC with production ready code, this was to maximise my learning.

### POC 3 My First Blazor App

My experience from the first two POCs put me in a good position to concentrate on the Blazor technology rather than the functionality of the app. It also forced me to tackle concepts such a rendering and state management that I might have a avoided at POC1 stage.  
I didn't like the guidance (or lack of) on state management here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/state-management?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=webassembly so I dicided to do some research into alternatives. As a result of this, I've stopped this POC and I'm moving onto POC 4 which will be with Blazor and [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor)

### POC 4 Blazor & Fluxor

Initial release soon, currently experimenting...
